# NHSX website

## About the NHSX website

From 1 July, NHSX will bring together teams from the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and NHS Improvement to drive digital transformation in health and care.

The NHSX website contains information about what we do, who we are, how we work and also links to key information and tools.

We have built the website using the [NHS.UK frontend library](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend).

## Quick start

### Running the application

Install the long-term support (LTS) version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, which also includes NPM.

Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:nhsx/nhsx-website.git nhsx-website`, then whilst in the project directory `cd nhsx-website`, install the required npm packages with: `npm install`

Run the project in development mode `npm run watch` and visit <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.
