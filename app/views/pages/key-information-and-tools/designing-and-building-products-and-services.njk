    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Data-driven health and care technology</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology/initial-code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology">code of conduct</a> (Department of Health and Social Care, 2019) sets out what is expected of people developing, deploying and using data-driven technologies.</p>
    <p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.kssahsn.net/what-we-do/our-news/news/Documents/AI-Strategy.pdf">state of the nation survey (PDF, 745 KB)</a> in 2018 that provided invaluable insights into AI technologies being developed, we want to go one step further and understand where they are being developed and what problems they are solving. This tangible information will help us to build and nurture the development of an ecosystem: we want to assess what else is needed in terms of policies, investment, education, support and regulation to ensure we achieve our aims.</p>
    <p>If you or anyone in your network is developing, deploying or utilising data driven technology, please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VV2KPXX">take our survey on AI in health and care</a> now or share it with colleagues who may be interested.</p>
