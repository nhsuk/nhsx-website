    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Legal considerations</h2>
    <p>The legal framework has flexibility when it comes to the processing of information. Information relating to the Covid-19 outbreak should be shared as needed to support individual care and to help tackle the disease through research and planning during the Covid-19 situation.  The focus should be to ensure the risk of damage, harm or distress being caused to individual patients and service users is kept to a minimum and that data is only processed where it is necessary to do so and in an appropriate manner.</p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Confidential Patient Information/Common law duty of confidentiality</h3>
    <p>The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has directed NHS Digital to collect and analyse data from providers and other organisations involved in managing the Covid-19 response and then disseminate information to other bodies for the purpose of planning and managing the response. NHS England and NHS Improvement have been given legal notice to support the processing and sharing of information to help the Covid-19 response under Health Service Control of Patient Information Regulations 2002.</p>
    <p>Individual healthcare organisations, Arms Length Bodies (except NHS Digital and NHS England and NHS Improvement which have been separately notified) and Local Authorities have now also been given legal notice under the same regulations to support the processing and sharing of information to help the Covid-19 response. The notice is available <a href="/assets/Final_General_COPI_Notice.pdf">here</a>. Frequently asked questions are answered below.</p>
    <p>This is to ensure that confidential patient information can be used and shared appropriately and lawfully for purposes related to the Covid-19 response.</p>
    <p>These Notices will be reviewed on or before 30 September 2020 and may be extended by further notice in writing. If no further notice is sent they will expire on 30 September 2020.</p>
    <p>Data controllers are still required to comply with relevant and appropriate data protection standards and to ensure within reason that they operate within statutory and regulatory boundaries.</p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
    <p>The GDPR allows information to be shared for individual care, planning and research. Where health and care information (which would be classed as special category data) is shared for either individual care or to help tackle the disease through research and planning then the relevant Article 6 conditions (official authority, compliance with a legal obligation, public interest and on occasion vital interests) and Article 9 conditions (substantial public interest, the delivery of health and care, vital interests or for public health purposes and scientific research) should be relied on as applicable to the situation.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/">principles</a> (Article 5 of GDPR) should continue to be followed. They form a framework of good information management with the key criteria enabling justification of actions taken. If you are not certain of an issue, such as a relevant retention time, then the law is flexible enough to allow you to revisit the issue once the answer becomes clearer.</p>
    <p>If your organisation is going to process personal/confidential patient information in ways not covered by an existing Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), e.g. using videoconferencing for consultations, then a short high level DPIA should be carried out. The DPIA should set out the activity being proposed; the data protection risks; whether the proposed activity is necessary and proportionate; the mitigating actions that can be put in place and a plan or confirmation that mitigation has been put in place. DPIAs are scalable, and in some instances this might not take more than a couple of pages. The ICO has produced <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/">guidance on carrying out DPIAs</a> and a template that you can refer to. You should also update your privacy notice where data is being processed in new ways.</p>
   
    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">COPI Notice - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Why are you doing this?</h3>
    <p>The health and care system is facing an unprecedented challenge and we want to ensure that healthcare organisations, Arms Length Bodies and local authorities are able to process and share the data they need to respond to Covid-19 for example by treating and caring for patients and those at risk, managing the service and identifying patterns and risks.</p>
    <p>As part of a wider package of measures, including guidance and directions, the Secretary of State has issued a range of Notices which require that data is shared for purposes of Covid-19. They will help give healthcare organisations and local authorities the confidence to share the data needed to respond to Covid-19.</p>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What are COPI notices?</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1438/contents/made/">Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002</a> allow the processing of Confidential Patient Information (CPI) for specific purposes. Regulation 3 provides for the processing of CPI in relation to communicable diseases and other threats to public health and in particular allows the Secretary of State to require organisations to process CPI for purposes related to communicable diseases.</p> 
    <p>The Secretary of State has issued four of these <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-notification-of-data-controllers-to-share-information/">notices</a> requiring NHS Digital, NHS England & Improvement, all healthcare organisations, Arms Length Bodies, Local Authorities and GPs (including a specific requirement related to the UK Biobank project) to process CPI for the purposes related to communicable diseases.</p>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What does processing mean?</h3>
    <p>Under COPI Regulations 2002, processing means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the use, dissemination and obtaining of information;</li> 
      <li>the recording and holding of information;</li>
      <li>the retrieval, alignment and combination of information;</li>
      <li>the organisation, adaption or alteration of information;</li>
      <li>the blocking, erasure and destruction of information.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What purposes are covered?</h3>
    <p>The COPI notices cover a range of purposes related to diagnosing, managing, and controlling the spread of communicable diseases. For Covid-19 purposes this could include but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>understanding Covid-19 and risks to public health, trends in Covid-19 and such risks, and controlling and preventing the spread of Covid-19 and such risks;</li> 
      <li>identifying and understanding information about patients or potential patients with or at risk of Covid-19;</li>
      <li>delivering services to patients, clinicians, the health services;</li>
      <li>research and planning in relation to Covid-19.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What type of data is covered?</h3>
    <p>The notice covers confidential patient information so any data regardless of its identifiability, which is being used for the purposes set out above is covered. It will all be treated in line with the principles of GDPR i.e. fairly, lawfully and securely.</p>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">How long will the notices be in place?</h3>
    <p>These Notices will be reviewed on or before 30 September 2020 and may be extended by further notice in writing. If no further notice is sent, they will expire on 30 September 2020. This means that processing of data will be stopped and information shared for the specific purpose of Covid-19 will be deleted.</p>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What if I’m unsure about sharing data?</h3>
    <p>If you are unsure about the appropriate action to take, please contact <a href="mailto:England.IGPolicyTeam@nhs.net">England.IGPolicyTeam@nhs.net</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What about GDPR?</h3>
    <p>Data controllers are still required to comply with relevant and appropriate data protection standards and to ensure within reason that they operate within statutory and regulatory boundaries. The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) allow health and care data to be used as long as one or more of the conditions under Article 6 and Article 9 are met. There are conditions under both Articles which can be relied on for the sharing of health and care data – including ‘the care and treatment of patients’ and ‘public health’. We would expect any organisation to disseminate information within legal requirements set out under GDPR.</p>
    
    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What if I have opted-out of my data being used (National Data Opt-Out)?</h3>
    <p>The national data opt-out does not apply to disclosure of confidential patient information if it is being used to protect public health, for example to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>diagnose communicable diseases;</li> 
      <li>control or prevent their spread;</li>
      <li>deliver and monitor vaccination programmes;</li>
      <li>manage risks of infection from food or water supplies or the environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Read a full explanation of the lawful basis of such disclosures in <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-data-opt-out/operational-policy-guidance-document/when-does-a-national-data-opt-out-not-apply#6-2-communicable-diseases-and-risks-to-public-health/">6.2:Communicable diseases and risks to public health</a> in the operational policy guidance document.</p>
