    <p>We are keen to hear from everyone who is affected by the technology we use in health and care, from patients to technologists and innovators to carers to clinicians.</p>

    <h2>Listening to digital health innovators</h2>

    <p>On 4 July 2019, NHSX held a listening event for innovators working in healthtech, in partnership with the Accelerated Access Collaborative, the Academic Health Science Network, the Office for Life Sciences and TechUK. At the event, we asked the innovators what NHSX's priorities should be. This report details the key themes that emerged and how we are responding to them.</p>
